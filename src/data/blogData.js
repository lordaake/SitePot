All offers will be considered, but they must be realisticâ€”no guarantee of acceptance at the minimum, as 500 USD is quite low in today\'s economy (not even enough for half a month\'s food).' },

They are easier to remember, perform better in search engines due to user familiarity, and hold higher resale value according to industry reports from sources like GoDaddy and Namecheap.' },
